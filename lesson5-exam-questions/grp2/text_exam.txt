Exam 25 July 2022

Solve the following 4 exercises by writing scripts that will be saved, respectively, as "solution_1.xq", "solution_2.xq", "solution_3.xq","solution_4.xq" within the folder "exam2" (use relative paths to refer to the files phi0448.phi001.perseus-lat2.xml and 
treebank_eng.xml).

1) Tokenize the text inside the <body> element of the file phi0448.phi001.perseus-lat2.xml: a token is defined as a string separated by one or more whitespace characters (in a regular expression, the relevant argument should be "\s+"). Tokens will be grouped on de basis of their word form, alphabetically ordered, and counted, as shown in result_1.xml

2) Transform the phi0448.phi001.perseus-lat2.xml so that the text inside the <body> element is capitalized, as shown in result_2.xml. 

3) Find all sentences in the file treebank_eng.xml which contain a subordinate clause introduced by
"after" (look at @upos to identify the right "after") and return such clauses as shown in result_3.xml (the tokens returned are the ones following "after" and separated by one space by default, regardless of whether there is no space in the original sentence text).

4) Find all verbs and their direct syntactic dependents in the file treebank_eng.xml and group and order them by the number of dependents, as shown in results_4.xml. Verbs are defined such by their @upos value.
